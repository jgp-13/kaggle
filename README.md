# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸŒŠðŸš¢

This repository contains my analysis and solution for the **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using Python and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

The Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly challenge in predictive modelling and data science. By analysing passenger information such as age, gender, class, and other features, the task is to build a machine learning model that predicts survival.

## Features of the Project

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handling missing values.  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features like family size or ticket prefixes).  
  - Data normalization and encoding categorical variables.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualising distributions of survival rates.  
  - Investigating correlations between features and survival.  
  - Identifying outliers and trends.  

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Logistic Regression.  
  - Random Forest.  
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).  
  - Comparison of models and hyperparameter tuning.  

- **Evaluation:**  
  - Accuracy score and cross-validation.  
  - Submission to Kaggle for leaderboard performance.
